# Analysis of metagenomics data

This project is part of the course of Computational Microbial Genomics (Prof. Segata, 2022).

The analysis starts from a pool of Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) and is divided into:
* Genome annotation
* Pangenome analysis
* Phylogenetic structure
* Taxonomic annotation
* Association with host data
