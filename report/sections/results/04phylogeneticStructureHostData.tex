\subsection*{Phylogenetic Structure and association with host data}
\graphicspath{{images/phylogeneticStructureHostData/}}


% Phylogenetic analysis and association with host data: comparison of phylogenetic
% trees based on accessory gene presence/absence or on core gene alignment.
% Do you detect clusters of strains? How do they associate with the metadata?

Significant differences were found between the tree obtained from the presence/absence of genes
and the one built from the core gene alignement (figure \ref{fig:phylogenetic trees}). Instead,
MAFFT and PRANK produced core gene alignements that resulted in identical trees
(figure \ref{core alignement mafft tree}). 

Three main clusters were seen in every tree, but the low number of samples and the high fragmentation of
information seen in the metadata impede the observation of finer clustering.
