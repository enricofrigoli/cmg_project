%%% What software you used for each purpose, what parameters

A total of 31 HQ genomes (29 SGBs and 2 reference genome) were used in this study.

%%%% PANGENOME ANALYSIS 
The species' pangenome was obtained using Roary 3.7.0 (citation) based on Prokka annotation files (.gff). 
The following parameters were given: \emph{-i 95} to set the minimum percentage of identity
in the blastp alignement to 95\%, \emph{-cd 90} to set the prevalence in \% MAGs for a gene
to be considered a core one, \emph{-e} to produce the alignement using PRANK, \emph{-p 8} to
specify the number of threads.
